# ML_LoanPrediction 🎉💼

Welcome to the Loan Prediction Machine Learning Project repository! 🚀 This project aims to predict loan eligibility for customers using advanced machine learning techniques. Our objective is to create a model that accurately forecasts whether a customer qualifies for a loan based on various attributes such as marital status, education, and employment status.

## Overview 🌟

This repository includes the complete code and documentation for our project. We focused on understanding the relationships between customer attributes and loan eligibility to build a reliable predictive model. Our project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature analysis, and the implementation of classification algorithms.

## Key Features 🔍

- **Data Exploration:** 
  - Conduct an in-depth analysis of datasets to explore the impact of features like marital status, education levels, and employment statuses on loan eligibility.
  - Identify patterns and correlations that influence loan approval rates.

- **Data Preprocessing:** 
  - Address missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
  - Encode categorical variables and normalize data for effective model training.

- **Feature Analysis:** 
  - Uncover trends and insights, such as gender disparities and correlations between educational attainment and loan uptake.
  - Use statistical methods and visualizations to better understand the data.

- **Model Implementation:** 
  - Implement classification algorithms including Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

## Project Highlights 🏆

- **Second Place Achievement:** 
  - We’re thrilled to announce that our project clinched second place among the top entries in our competition in ML Applai workshop! 🥈
  - Special thanks to our teammate Mostafa El Sharkawy and our supervisor Toka Khaled for their invaluable support and expertise.
  - Shoutout to ApplAi for organizing the workshop and providing this opportunity to delve into machine learning.
