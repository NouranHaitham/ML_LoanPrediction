# Loan Prediction Machine Learning Project
Welcome to our Loan Prediction Machine Learning Project repository! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for our machine learning project focused on predicting loan eligibility for customers based on various attributes such as marital status, education, employment status, and more. The objective of this project is to develop a robust model that accurately predicts whether a customer is eligible for a loan or not.

## Key Features
*Data Exploration:* We delve deep into the datasets, analyzing features like marital status, education levels, employment statuses, and more to understand their impact on loan eligibility.

*Data Preprocessing:* We tackle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables to prepare the data for model training.

*Feature Analysis:* Uncovering intriguing trends among loan applicants, from gender disparities to correlations between educational attainment and loan uptake.

*Model Implementation:* We implement classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and KNN to predict loan eligibility, evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
